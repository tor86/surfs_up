Summary
---
The data presented shows that there is not a large difference in the overall summary statistics gathered for each month proving that Oahu is likely a good spot for W. Avy's business with ice cream and surf being an option most of the year. 
Analysis should also take into consideration the amount of precipitation during those months as it can deter surfers and ice cream goers. Additional analysis should also be performed on nearby locations to compare the summary statistics between them and Oahu to ensure W. Avy is choosing the best location for them in regards of data not just what location they may "like" the most.
